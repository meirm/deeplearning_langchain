# DeepLearning LangChain Course Updates (Unofficial)

This repository contains original and updated Jupyter notebooks from the DeepLearning.ai mini-course on LangChain. The course, designed by one of LangChain's authors, provides a comprehensive introduction to LangChain concepts and their practical application.

## Overview

The original course materials, while informative, were based on older versions of the LangChain library and the OpenAI API. This repository aims to bridge the gap by offering updated notebooks that are compatible with the latest versions of these libraries.

## Contents

- `original_notebook.ipynb`: The original Jupyter notebook as provided in the course.
- `updated_notebook.ipynb`: The updated Jupyter notebook with modifications to work with current library versions.

## Updates and Modifications

The updated notebook includes:
- Revised code to match the latest API and library standards.
- Additional comments explaining each update and modification for educational purposes.
